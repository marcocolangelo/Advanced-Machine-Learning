# Advanced-Machine-Learning
The repository contains the materials related to the Advanced Machine Learning 2023/2024 course at Politecnico di Torino. Deep learning techniques are explored and exploited 

The course covers the following topics:
- Overview of fundamental knowledge of probability
- Overview of decision theory: loss, risk, Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) Learning
- Perceptron and Artificial Neural Networks
- Convolutional Neural Networks basic algorithms: Backpropagation and Stochastic Gradient Descent
- Training a CNN (data preprocessing, weight initialization and hyperparameter optimization)
- Visualizing and Understanding the CNN inner working
- Multi-Task and Structured Output Learning (Semantic Segmentation and Detection)
- Unsupervised and Metric Learning (Siamese networks and Contrastive Learning for Retrieval) - Generative Networks (Autoencoders and GANs)
- Recurrent Neural Networks
- Learning with few samples and across domains
- Active and Incremental learning
- Basic concepts and networks for Reinforcement Learning
